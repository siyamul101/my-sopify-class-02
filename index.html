			<h1>Benefits of  Mixed Vegetables</h1>
			<p>Vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet. When you eat them, 
			   variety is just as important as the quantity you eat. This is because no 
		       single vegetable provides all the health benefits you need. However, eating 
		       a variety of vegetables gives you access to different health benefits and 
		       nutrients. So, you must eat as many different vegetables as you can every day! </p>
			<p>I think mixed vegetables can help you eat a variety of vegetables, in one meal.
			   And this can help improve your health quickly</p>
